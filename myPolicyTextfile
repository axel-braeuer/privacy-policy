blabla bla this is my policy

It is only a students project. A pretty cool one though. Don´t expect it to be perfect. 
Some things might not work as intended, because the semester ends soon and I have no time to test it on 100+ devices. But hey, since it´s costless, 
i won´t accept bad critics anyway, except maybe from my professors and collegues at university and friends who also do programming, which i don´t have,
except one, but he lives in an other town 200km from my place, so...

btw if the ball gets stuck, it might help when you shake your device.
